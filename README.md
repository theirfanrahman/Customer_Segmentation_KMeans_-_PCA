# Customer_Segmentation_KMeans_-_PCA

Did you know that you can combine Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and K-means Clustering to improve segmentation results?

In this tutorial, we’ll see a practical example of a mixture of PCA and K-means for clustering data using Python.

Why Combine PCA and K-means?
There are varying reasons for using a dimensionality reduction step such as PCA prior to data segmentation. Chief among them? By reducing the number of features, we’re improving the performance of our algorithm. On top of that, by decreasing the number of features the noise is also reduced.
